1. What areas of IT do you see undergoing the most rapid transformation,
both before, during and after an event?

2. Can you share your thoughts or concerns about the process for
in person identification during an event? Is the risk of fraud
(ie a person impersonating someone else) a major or minor concern?

3. Many organizations issue certifications. Is there a need for
greater certification interoperability? Can you think of any specific
examples where this was an issue?

4. Can you share your thoughts about the challenges of accounting for
which people responded to an event (post event).

5. What kinds of digital sites/apps reliance on password authentication
could present a risk?

6. Can you think of any specific examples where better tools for
person identification or the communication of skills would have helped?

7. The project we are working on will try to enroll federal, state,
and local government agencies into a common mobile credential platform.
It will also potentially include private organizations. If this could be
accomplished in a secure, privacy protecting manner, can you anticipate
any objections? Can you think of any incentives that would drive
participation?
