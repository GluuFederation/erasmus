1. NIEF is a federation for large organizations in the law enforcement
community. The ERASMUS federation would use a similar federated model, but
would try to extend its reach to smaller law enforcement organizations, to fire
and emergency medical, as well as to some private organizations. Can you think
of any ways that the creation of such a federation might be useful to the FBI?

2. Smart cards are pretty secure, but they are expensive and technically
challenging to issue, especially for state and local governments. Do you
think a lower assurance, but more widely adopted, mobile credential would
be useful to the FBI, especially in the context of responding to large,
multi-jurisdictional emergency event?

3. The law enforcement community is increasingly adopting digital services that
require strong authentication, for example email, CAD, training and cloud file
management. Does the use of passwords to access these services concern you? If
so, what are some of the deployment challenges that the law enfocement community
is facing that prevents the roll out of stronger authentication technology?

4. Many organizations issue certifications. Is there a need for
greater certification interoperability? Can you think of any specific
examples where this was an issue?

5. Do you see any other important opportunities for a mobile credential, for
example, perhaps as a communication tool during an event, or as a mechanism for
better post-event accounting?

6. The strength of a digital credential is only as good as the identity
management process through which it was issued. Do you see a need for
first responders to improve their underlying identity management processes, and
if so, are there currently any programs that you know of to help them do this?

7. Any other thoughts about why a mobile credential is either a good or
bad idea?
