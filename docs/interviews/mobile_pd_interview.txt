We have our own authentication, it's not done through their own agency.

 10-15 people at the agency.

"We are gathering background information to understand digital identiy in
emergency responder community."

More and more, paper tasks are moving to apps.

 There is a lot they haven't figured it out.

a) What kinds of digital and in person credenitals FR's are using.
b) What kinds of websites and mobile applications FR's are using for work.
C) How much friction exists accessing digital resources.
