# Overview

In the field of emergency management it is widely known that crisis situations consistently overwhelm the resources of the jurisdictions they affect.   To build the next generation of tools to respond to crisis situations--either man-made or natural--we need increased capability to identify and authenticate first responders.

This is a daunting task--in the US, there are over 65,000 law enforcement, fire and EMS organizations and approximately three million individuals. While centralized identity management processes can achieve a high level of security, a decentralized process may offer less security, but enable wider participation.

With the chaos, threat, and uncertainty that accompany such disasters, allowing unauthorized people to access an emergency site not only puts them in danger, but may endanger fellow emergency responders. Conversely, turning away qualified people is also a problem.  

In such situations, it is crucial to have a simple, easy, and secure method to confirm essential details about an emergency responder, namely that their skills, credentials, and authorizations are valid and up-to-date. To achieve this goal, we need dependable technology (tools) and scalable organizational cooperation (rules).

Can a decentralized identity infrastructure convey the identity, skills and authorizations of a first responder in real time? Can the risks inherent in the varying security capabilities of 65,000 organizations be conveyed, enabling applications that consume this data to present it as actionable information? To achieve this goal, we need dependable technology (tools) and scalable organizational cooperation (rules).

## Scope of Pilot
Phase I of the ErasmErasmus Project was a 6-month pilot project (February -August 2017) that would test whether technology is available to make this security versus adoption trade-off. The goal of the pilot was to develop a proof of concept that would:

    1. 1.	Demonstrate how a decentralized identity federation could provide an inclusive, flexible infrastructure.
    2.	Leverage the latest identity standards to meet the need of applications for electronic verification of identity, skills, and authorizations while simultaneously allowing for greater accountability on the scene of a disaster.
    3.	Use trustmarks to enable organizations to convey security risks in a machine readable format
    4.	Develop a proof of concept mobile application that demonstrates the potential to access real time information.
    5.	Provide a design to enhance the federated credentials with the cryptographic capabilities of a smartphone.
    6.	Protect the privacy of first responders by insuring that federation minimizes the persistence of unencrypted personally identifiable information.

## Problem Defined

The emergency management community has been working to address the gaps in the tools and rules that currently limit an emergency responder to assist in another jurisdiction. These include legislation to facilitate rapid collaboration, settling questions about payments and liability, such as the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). Tools include technology solutions such as the First Responder Authentication Credentials (FRAC) cards, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, or other cards (and identity management processes for issuance) with a cryptographic chip (“smart cards”). Each of these are aimed at providing the trust framework to enable an Incident Commander to gain confidence in the ability of a person to perform the tasks assigned.

However, feedback from the emergency responder community suggest that the rules and tools for solving in-person identification in the field of emergency management are not getting the job done. Smart cards are theoretically a scalable solution but existing tools and rules have been difficult to implement. Many states are adopting the technology. But some states may adopt only part of the smart card standards, while others may try a different approach. The diversity of jurisdictions in the United States makes agreement on a single solution almost impossible. Top-down approaches may work in small countries, but not in the United States, where licensing requirements and regulating bodies vary widely from county to county, and state to state.  

### Highly decentralized

An overarching challenge is that  emergency responder ecosystem in the US is highly decentralized--there are over 65,000 organizations, with  millions of affiliated people.  There is currently no universal, interoperable identity infrastructure.  The dimensions of the problem are threefold.  The first concerns center mainly around identity requirements.

For example:
  * Who are you? What skills do you have? Are you authorized? What is your jurisdiction?
  For example:
  *	Who are you? What skills do you have? Are you authorized? What is your jurisdiction?
  *	Is this first responder who they say they are?
  *	What is the first responder’s qualified to do? (hazmat tech, FF, EMT, LE, types and kinds of resources qualified to operate)
  *	How can the first responder be accounted for?
  *	What jurisdiction, agency or area of responsibility does the responder belong to? (local, state, federal, other)
	Is this first responder who they say they are?
  * What is the first responder’s qualified to do? (hazmat tech, FF, EMT, LE, types and kinds of resources qualified to operate)
  *	How can the first responder be accounted for?
  *	What jurisdiction, agency or area of responsibility does the responder belong to? (local, state, federal, other)
